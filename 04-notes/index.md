# Lab Knowledge Base

This directory contains structured, topic-based documentation for my home SOC lab.
Each file captures a reusable concept, configuration, troubleshooting step, or detection workflow-**not a daily log**, but a reference for future me (and collaborators).

> 🔍 Tip: Use `Ctrl+F` or your editor's search to find topics quickly.
> 📁 All artifacts (rules, scripts, dashboards) are linked from here.
